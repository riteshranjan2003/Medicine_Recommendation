# Medical-Recommendation-System
## Project Overview
This project involves building a machine learning model to predict the disease based on symptom. The system is deployed using Flask, providing an interactive and user-friendly interface for predictions.
## Features
* Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, encoding categorical data, and scaling features.

* Model Training: Using a Support Vector Classifier for accurate predictions.

* Deployment: Implemented with Flask for an interactive interface.

## Technology Used
* Python

* Jupyter Notebook

* NumPy

* Pandas

* Scikit-learn

* Flask
## Model Training
A Support Vector Classifier is used for training the model. The dataset is split into training and testing sets with a ratio of 70:30.
## Deployment With Flask
Flask is used to create an interactive interface where users can input symptoms and receive predictions about the diseases they might have. The application takes inputs for
* Symptoms
